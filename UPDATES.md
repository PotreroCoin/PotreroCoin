# Build and Qt signal fixes
- Added phasing details for successful `make` builds: Queues now include `<deque>`, `std::array`/`std::numeric_limits` headers, and missing `<stdexcept>` to repay errors emitted from gcc 13 tooling. `(httpserver.cpp, bench/bench.h, net_processing.cpp, support/lockedpool.cpp)`
- Made signal connections store their `boost::signals2::connection` results (`init.cpp`) and explicitly import the placeholder symbols before `boost::bind` calls in validation/Qt modules so the newer Boost headers compile cleanly under current warnings (`validation*.cpp`, `qt/*.cpp`).
- Replaced comma-containing `Q_FOREACH` loops with range-based `for` loops in `paymentserver`, Qt tests, and dt desc logic to avoid macro issues with modern Qt headers while keeping behavior unchanged.
- Added `const` qualifiers to comparator functors in miner/txmempool and ensured Qt widgets include needed classes (`QPainterPath`, `<deque>` for tests) so `make` completes without `-Werror` interruptions; `txmempool.h`, `miner.h`, `test/…`, and Qt widgets affected.
- Documented that Linux builds run `./autogen.sh`, `./build/install_db4.sh`, `./configure`, `make`, and `make install`, noted that the helper runs manually between autogen and configure, and highlighted that configure now auto-detects the `db4/` tree so manual `BDB_*` overrides are unnecessary (`doc/build-unix.md`).
- Pointed the default `BDB_CFLAGS`/`BDB_LIBS` paths at the helper's `db4/` tree by computing `db4_abs_srcdir` from `srcdir`, so configure can find the bundled Berkeley DB even when building from subdirectories (`configure.ac:598`).
